# Classifying Driving Behaviour With Long Short-Term Memory
This is the repository of code for my UOW ECTE355 Thesis Project.

The UAH DriveSet has not been included in this repository. To verify the workings of the code download and unzip the UAH DriveSet, set up an Anaconda & Jupyter environment with the libraries used in the code.

Rename the dataset folder to 'Dataset'. Change the code to use your personal directory path and run the 'Overall Combined Code' in a Jupyter Notebook with Python 3.6.
